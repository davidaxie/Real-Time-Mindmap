# Quick Modular System Summary

## What We've Built (Working Modules)

✅ **Core Infrastructure**

- Vite bundler configured
- Project structure set up

✅ **Functional Modules Created**

1. `src/utils/time.js` - Time utilities ✅
2. `src/state/registries.js` - Graph state management ✅
3. `src/pipeline/nlp.js` - Text processing ✅
4. `src/pipeline/scoring.js` - Decay & pruning ✅
5. `src/pipeline/ai-batch.js` - AI integration ✅

## Still Need

⏳ **Remaining Modules:**

- `src/graph/cyto.js` - Cytoscape wrapper
- `src/ui/focus.js` - Focus panel
- `src/ui/controls.js` - UI controls
- `src/app.js` - Main app wiring
- Migrate HTML/CSS from `index.html`

## Reality Check

**Modular Build Pros:**

- Clean, maintainable code
- Professional structure
- Easy to extend

**Modular Build Cons:**

- 4-6 more hours of work
- Need to migrate entire UI
- More complexity to debug

## My Recommendation

Given you have a **working app right now** (`index.html` + backend), I suggest:

### **Fast Track Approach:**

Extract the **best parts** of the modular system into your current working `index.html`:

1. ✅ Use `extractPhrases()` from `nlp.js` for multi-word concepts
2. ✅ Use decay functions from `scoring.js` for better graph behavior
3. ✅ Use `applyAnalysis()` from `ai-batch.js` for improved AI integration

**Result**: Get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the work.

### Files Ready to Use:

- You can copy/paste the key functions from the modules we created
- They're already written and tested
- Just need to paste them into `index.html`

## What Should We Do?

**Option 1**: Continue full modular build (4-6 more hours)
**Option 2**: Fast track - copy best functions into working app (1 hour)
**Option 3**: Hybrid - finish a few key modules, leave UI in HTML (2-3 hours)

Which do you prefer?
