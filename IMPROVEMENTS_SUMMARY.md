# Fast-Track Improvements Applied

## What We Just Added

### 1. **Multi-Word Phrase Extraction** âœ…

- **Function**: `extractPhrases()`
- **What it does**: Extracts 2-word phrases like "machine learning", "vector database"
- **Benefit**: Creates more meaningful concepts instead of just single words
- **Weight**: Phrases get 1.5x weight of single tokens (more important)

### 2. **Enhanced Graph Connections** âœ…

- **What's new**: Phrases are connected to their component words
- **Benefit**: Better clustering of related concepts
- **Example**: "machine learning" node connects to both "machine" and "learning" nodes

### 3. **Duplicate Detection** âœ…

- **Function**: `isDuplicate()` with anti-stutter logic
- **What it does**: Prevents processing the same text within 1 second
- **Benefit**: Avoids duplicate nodes from speech recognition repeats

### 4. **Improved AI Integration** (Already working)

- AI-extracted concepts get 5x weight
- AI relationships create high-quality edges
- Alias detection for concept variations

## How It Works Now

### Before:

- Single words only: "machine", "learning", "database", "vector"
- Simple sequential connections

### After:

- Single words: "machine", "learning", "database", "vector"
- **Plus phrases**: "machine learning", "vector database"
- Hierarchical connections: "machine learning" â†’ "machine" + "learning"

## Testing It

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Start Listening"**
3. **Try saying**:

   - "Machine learning is about artificial intelligence"
   - "Vector databases store embeddings efficiently"
   - "Python programming is great for data science"

4. **Watch for**:
   - Multi-word phrases appearing as single nodes
   - Stronger connections between related concepts
   - No duplicate nodes from speech recognition

## What You Should See

### In the Graph:

- Larger nodes for multi-word phrases
- Dense clustering around topics
- Less noise from single words

### In the Transcript:

- Clean, non-repeated segments
- Better grouping of related concepts

## API Keys Status

âœ… **No new API keys needed!**

- Still using Groq only
- Backend handles API calls securely
- API key stored in `.env` (not in git)

## Next Steps (Optional)

Want even better results?

1. **Enable 3-word phrases** (uncomment lines in extractPhrases)
2. **Tune phrase weights** (currently 1.5x, try 2x)
3. **Add community detection** (color by topic clusters)
4. **Pin high-value nodes** (keep important concepts stable)

## Files Modified

- âœ… `index.html` - Added phrase extraction, duplicate detection, enhanced connections
- âœ… Backend unchanged (still working)
