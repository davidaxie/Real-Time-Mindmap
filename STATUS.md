# Project Status - Modular Build System

## ✅ What's Done

### Infrastructure

- ✅ Vite installed and configured
- ✅ Build scripts added to package.json
- ✅ Project structure created (src/ folders)
- ✅ Migration guide created

### Core Modules Created

- ✅ `src/utils/time.js` - Time utilities, throttling, formatting
- ✅ `src/state/registries.js` - Graph state management, concepts/edges/segments
- ✅ `src/pipeline/nlp.js` - Text processing, phrase extraction, deduplication

### Backend (Unchanged)

- ✅ Express server running on port 3000
- ✅ Groq API integration working
- ✅ API endpoints functional

## ⏳ What's Next

### Immediate Tasks

1. Create remaining pipeline modules:

   - `src/pipeline/scoring.js` - Decay, pruning, weight management
   - `src/pipeline/ai-batch.js` - AI batch processing
   - `src/pipeline/asr.js` - Speech recognition event handling

2. Create visualization module:

   - `src/graph/cyto.js` - Cytoscape wrapper, incremental updates

3. Create UI modules:

   - `src/ui/focus.js` - Node click handlers
   - `src/ui/controls.js` - Button/control wiring

4. Create main app:
   - `src/app.js` - Wire everything together
   - Migrate HTML/CSS to `src/index.html`

## 🎯 Goal

Transform the working single-file `index.html` into a modular, maintainable system with:

- Better concept extraction (multi-word phrases)
- Improved scoring with decay
- Stable graph layout
- Clean separation of concerns

## 📝 Next Steps

You have two paths forward:

### Option A: Continue modular build (Recommended for long-term)

Complete the remaining modules as outlined above. This will take more time but results in a maintainable, scalable system.

### Option B: Hybrid approach

Use the modular utilities (time.js, nlp.js, registries.js) we've created by importing them into a slightly refactored version of the current `index.html`. Faster, less disruptive.
